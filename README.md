# R-projects
Includes work in R from Multivariate Linear Analysis, Forecasting, and Statistical Analysis modules.

Highlights: 
- 'MichaelHaskins.pdf' is a report completed for a Forecasting module. Unfortunately the HTML version of the report, which is formatted nicely, is too large to view on github.
- MvLA Report is a report on heart data which contains readings of patients of two classes, those who have heart disease and those who don't. In this report I use machine learning algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) and some supervised and unsupervised classification methods to attain the group structure of the data and predict whether a new patient would have heart disease based on their readings.
