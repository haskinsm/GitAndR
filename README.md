# R-projects
Includes work in R from Multivariate Linear Analysis and Forecasting modules.

Highlights: 
 -'MichaelHaskins.RMD' is a report completed for a Forecasting module. Unfortunately the HTML file is too large to view on github, but if you open the RMD file in R Studio and press the Knit button you should be able to view the file as a webpage where its formatted nicely.
